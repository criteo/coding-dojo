_See https://medium.com/criteo-engineering/why-and-how-we-organize-coding-dojos-654c6f1bf1a7 to find out more about coding dojos in general, and the context of the repo in particular_

Coding dojos is a practice for developers to sharpen their skills. Find out more instance [on this page](https://codingdojo.org/practices/WhatIsCodingDojo/) or with [this podcast](https://se-radio.net/2024/08/se-radio-629-emily-bache-on-katas-and-the-importance-of-practice/).

There are a lot of topics for coding dojos available on the Internet, for instance:
- https://codingdojo.org/ for [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) focused topics
- https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata for a refactoring based topic

In general a significative part of the coding dojo is spent writting tests. Which is great, since the point is often to practice TDD. However, sometimes we're more interested in practicing other software engineers skills.

That's the point of this repo, as it contains topics with some test suites already written, so participants can focus on the implementation and the algorithm instead.
