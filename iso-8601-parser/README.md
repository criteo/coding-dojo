Overview
========

The goal of this dojo is to implement a parser of dates with format ISO 8601.
(nb: you can do this dojo even if you don't know anything about the format ISO 8601)

Since test cases are already written it means that you don't need to know anything about the ISO 8601 (ie: as long as the tests are green, it means that your implementation respect the specification).

What is nice about this dojo:
- the beginning is rather easy, but the 2nd test suite quickly adds some subtelties that are not so trivial to deal with.
- it accomodates well any duration (ideally plan 1h30-2h to do it, but you can already do something cool if you have less time, and you can go farther if you have more time).
- all tests are written, you won't need to write any, so you can completey focus on the algorithm.
- you can practice refactoring (because it's almost certain that your first code will end up being pretty messy ðŸ˜…).
- you will learn what the ISO 8601 is, and (almost) all the format it supports.


How this dojo is intended to be performed
==========================================

At first all tests are commented, and the placeholder implementation of the parser does not do much. The goal will be to uncomment the tests one by one and to get them to pass one by one. (Of course, you should take a moment to refactor your code if it starts to get messy as you implement more feature).

More precisely:

1. [Optional] You may want to read the section "Some context about ISO 8601" beforehands.
2. Open the test file `_1_TestDeserializeCalendarDates` and uncomment the first test
3. Run that test to ensure it fails
4. Open the file `DojoIso8601` and write the implementation to get that test to pass.
5. Uncomment the 2nd test, ensure that it fails, and write the implementation to get it green. Rinse an repeat for all the tests of this file.
6. You can continue with the test file `_2_TestDeserializeTimes`. Beware: this test suite will end up being more challenging than the first one ðŸ˜‰

If you planned to do a 1h30 or 2h dojo, it's expected that you don't reach the end of this test suite. If you do however (or if you want a longer dojo) you can continue with `_3_TestDeserializeOrdinalDates` and `_4_TestDeserializeWeekDates`

(if needed, or for curious ones, there is a working implementation at https://github.com/gturri/jISO8601/blob/master/src/main/java/fr/turri/jiso8601/Iso8601Deserializer.java )



Some context about ISO 8601
===========================

In a nutshell: ISO 8601 is an international standard to represent dates.
Since it defines several ways to represent a date, it makes it a bit tricky to have an exhaustive parser.

It is possible to start this dojo without knowing anything about ISO 8601: as long as you get all tests green it means your parser is correct. But you may still want to read this section before starting coding, in order to get an overview of what you will want to implement.

ISO 8601 defines several ways to represent a day. Here are (some non exhaustive) examples:

- Calendar format: Ex: 1985-03-31
- calendar format with less precision. Ex: 1985-03 (which is 1st March), 1985 (wihch is 1st January), 19 (which is 1st January 1900)
- Ordinal format: Ex: 1985-063 (ie: 63rd day of the year 1985)
- Week format: Ex: 1985-W10-2 (ie: 2nd day of the 10th week of the year 1985)
- Week format with less precision: Ex: 1985-W10 (ie: 1st day of the 10th week of 1985)

ISO 8601 also define compact formats, which means it ok to drop all '-'. Ex:

- 19850301 (compact calendar format)
- 1985063 (compact ordinal format)
- 1985W101 (compact week format)

The way to represent a given time during a day, is like this: <some-day-representation>T<hour-representation><optional-timezone>.

Here are some (non exhaustive) examples:

- 1985-03-04T12:30:45Z (ie: 12h, 30minutes, 45 seconds, in UTC (because 'Z' stands for UTC))
- 19850304T123045Z (same as above, but compact format)
- 1985-03-04T12:30:45 (same as above but in the local time zone)
- 1985-03-04T12:30:45+1130 (same as above but in a time zone whith an offset of 11h30 compared to UTC)
- 1985-03-04T12:30Z or 1985-03-04T12Z (time with less precision)
- 1985-03-04T12:30:45.123Z (milliseconds are represented as a fractional part. Nb: the spec says we can have as many digit as we want after the decimal separator)
- 1985-03-04T12:30.25Z (12h, 30 minutes, 15 seconds )

If you are curious, you can get more context on the [Wikipedia page of ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).


Nb: this is based on the specification from 2004. If you are knowlegeable about the specification from 2019 and how we could adapt this dojo accordingly, don't hesitate to get in touch with me!
